# Compatiblity List on Non-Steam games

One day when I was playing on my Steam Deck, I tried to look for some games that I could that were _not_ on Steam itself.
One of those games was Sonic P-06, made by ChaosX (which I think you should absolutely check out, but that's not the point here.)

While I was able to find like, 2 videos on the subject, I thought to myself. I worked on compatibility lists on my own, why not make one for the Steam Deck?

# But why though?

I want a list where I can easily search up a game that is _not_ on Steam, and see how it performs. Yes, you ___could___ just search the game up on YouTube, but I think it's way nicer to have one website containing all the info you need.

# Are you the only maintaining this?

No. However, _you_ can help too!
I made this repository specifically for the community, so that _anyone_ can report _any_ game that isn't on Steam.
However, there _are_ some rules I have to get across.

# Guideline on reporting a game here

- *Don't report a game that's already on Steam.*

  Valve already has their official way of testing games on their marketplace, so it's just a waste of time to do the same thing here when you already have a neat list on Steam itself.
  Some exceptions to this I guess is that, for example, if the game in question has the "Unsupported" label on it, or if Valve hasn't tested the game yet (but then if it *does* get tested in the near future, it would have to get removed from here.)

  Another exception is that if the game is not on for sale anymore on Steam (for example, _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_, or _FUSER_.)
- *Use the labels when making a report.*

  It's true that if you report the game, I *could* just set the label myself. But that would require a _lot_ of work if a lot of people are going to submit reports, so please please *please* add in the appropriate label yourself when possible.

That's all I could come up with in terms of the guidelines. 

If you want to add in a suggestion or if you're not happy with 'em, please set up an issue with the appropriate label about it! I would love to improve this list as much as I can.
